How to find the file you're looking for?


##Core
anything that can not be divided as a feature, goes into core directory. including: 

* Navigation
* Theming
* firebase Option file
* constant values
* App Widget
* Internationalization

##Feature
we seperate each feature into user interface and state management (UI) and business logic + getting data from local or remote sources (provider) and models

#UI is seperated into state management (bloc) and anything visible on screen (view)
